Hi, and welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Oscar, a software developer currently working as a software developer intern at Speedline Solutions. I am passionate about data analytics, RESTful APIs, and full-stack development, but always love delving into new problem domains. 

#### A little about me
* I'm a dual-citizen (Canadian and American)
* I have a Bachelor's in Applied Animal Biology from the University of British Columbia
* I started learning software development in January 2021
* My hobbies are board games, badminton, and being a cool guy 😎

#### What I'm currently working on
* My internship at Speedline Solutions 🍕
* Badminton Analytics Dashboard

#### Check out some of my projects 📖
* [Badminton Analytics Dashboard](http://analytics.badminton-api.com): A dashboard that queries the Badminton Singles API to pull up player match history, player head-to-head records, and analyze % chance of victory against another player.
* [Badminton Singles API](https://api.badminton-api.com): A webscraper + API that scrapes TournamentSoftware for singles matches, and stores it to be easily queried through URL parameters.
* [ScoutNinja!](https://scoutninja.herokuapp.com): A scavenger game inspired by Geoguesser where players can create scavenger games on google maps, and send them to friends to play.
